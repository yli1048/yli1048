# This program gets three test scores and displays their average.  It congratulates the user if the 
# average is a high score. The high score variable holds the value that is considered a high score.

HIGH_SCORE = 95

# Get the test scores.

test2 = int(input('Enter the score for test 2: '))

# Add input for test 3 because it is missing.

# Calculate the average test score.
average = (test1 + test2 + test3) / 3

# Print the average.

# If the average is a high score,
# congratulate the user.
# Changed the variable name to uppercase because Python is case-sensitive.

#Q2
#The area of a rectangle is the rectangleâ€™s length times its width. Write a program that asks for the length and width of two rectangles and prints to the user the area of both rectangles. 
#Get the dimensions of the two rectangles.

area_2 = rectangle_2_length * rectangle_2_width

#Print the area.
print('The area of rectangle 1 is ', area_1)

#Q3 
#Ask a user to enter their first name and their age and assign it to the variables name and age. 
#The variable name should be a string and the variable age should be an int.

#Using the variables name and age, print a message to the user stating something along the lines of:
# "Happy birthday, name!  You are age years old today!"
